# 7Learnings Data Scientist Code Challenges

Hello potential 7Learnings colleague!
This code challenge is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your skills and knowledge regarding data science as well as your ability to work independently and use documentation where required. 


## The Coding Challenge

This repository contains a jupyter notebook with the coding challenge consisting of 2 parts. We also provied data in `coding_challenge.csv` which you can use in case you get stuck in Part 1. 
Create a new git repository for this project and organize your code within that repo. You can provide your solution and thoughtprocess directly within the notebook.
Once you are finished commit and push your code and email the link to your 7Learnings contact.

We adivse you to use a virtual environment and install the dependencies there:
 ```
 virtualenv venv
 source venv/bin/activate
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 
In order to succesfully do this coding challenge you will need to create an [account](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin/signinchooser?service=cloudconsole&passive=1209600&osid=1&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.cloud.google.com%2Fbigquery%3Fref%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2FLogout%3Fservice%253Dcloudconsole%2526continue%253Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fconsole.cloud.google.com%2Fbigquery%2526hl%253Den_GB&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.cloud.google.com%2Fbigquery%3Fref%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Faccounts.google.com%2FLogout%3Fservice%253Dcloudconsole%2526continue%253Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fconsole.cloud.google.com%2Fbigquery%2526hl%253Den_GB&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin) for the google cloude console.
and run

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

#### Time Allotment
We respect your time and don't expect you to spend more than 3 hours on this. Try to get as far as you can, your solutions will then be discussed in the next interview, feel free to also add comments and explain what you intended to do. 


## What We Review

Your application will be reviewed by our engineers. The aspects of your code we will judge include:

- ability to get the technical environment set up 
- sql coding knowledge
- data cleansing and abstraction
- understanding of time-dependent data
- machine learning knowledge and evaluation metrics
