# 7Learnings Back-End Challenges

You're free to use any common languages and frameworks. Remember the next round is a pair-programming session with our engineer. You should feel comfortable with the language you've chosen.

As we use Python pervasively throughout our backend codebase; we will be pleased if you can use it.

### Overview

For this task, you will need a prototype a simple Fibonacci number service that provides N-th Fibonacci number. The caller will specify the index of the Fibonacci number in the request and the service will respond the value. The API can be HTTP, gRPC, or anything as you prefer. 

For the Fibonacci number, you can refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) for the details.

### Exmaple
We use HTTP protocol and JSON payload in the input and output examples.

Input
```
{
    "index": 10
}
```

Output
```
{
    "value": 55
}
```
